# Battleship
A quick Battle ship game wrote in c++.

C++ was one of the first programing languages I started trying to learn. I quickly got board of it.
As I found it easier to learn Python at the time. So I finnaly feel like trying to learn it again.
So, I decided to try my hand at a quick Battleship game.
